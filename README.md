**Soil Classification Challenge - IIT Ropar Hackathon**
A comprehensive deep learning solution for binary soil image classification using EfficientNet architectures with advanced ensemble techniques and test-time augmentation.

üèÜ Competition Overview
This project was developed for the Soil Image Classification Challenge organized by Annam.ai at IIT Ropar as part of their hackathon selection process. The task involves binary classification to determine whether images contain soil or not and Types of soils (Alluvial soil,Black Soil,Clay soil,Red soil) which classify which type of soil.
